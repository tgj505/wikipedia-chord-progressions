## Overview

I taught on the [doo-wop progression](https://viva.pressbooks.pub/openmusictheory/chapter/4-chord-schemas/#chapter-1623-section-1) and thaught it'd be interesting to plot the examples given on wikipedia to gauge its usage. The dataset is pretty small, but is still useful.

Essentially also a mini-project to help me learn virtual environments, .gitignore, git, and some offline practice with various packages' help files.

## Running yourself
- Clone the repo and install the required packages given in `requirements.txt`. Basically just Beautifulsoup, pandas, jupter notebook, and matplotlib and their requirements.
- `main.ipynb` leads through basic usage of the functions, including outputting plots.

There are pre-scraped .csv files and plots for some progressions already. Here's an example plot.
